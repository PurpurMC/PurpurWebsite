Building and setting up \ud83d\udd17 Initial setup \ud83d\udd17 Run the following command in the root of the project directory: 1 ./gradlew applyPatches Creating a patch \ud83d\udd17 Patches are effectively just commits in either Purpur-API or Purpur-Server . To create one, just add a commit to either repo and run ./gradlew rebuildPatches , and Gradle will place a patch in the patches folder. Modifying commits will also modify their corresponding patch file(s). See CONTRIBUTING.md for more detailed information. Compiling \ud83d\udd17 Use the command ./gradlew build to build the api and server. Gradle will place compiled jars under Purpur-API/build/libs and Purpur-Server/build/libs . To get a purpurclip jar, run ./gradlew paperclip .

What are the best purpur options? \ud83d\udd17 It's hard to summarize Purpur because then it wouldn't be fully representative of everything it can do. Take a look at the most liked features poll over on reddit. But that list is hardly exhaustive, so do make sure to check out all the available options, there's something for everyone \\o/ https://purpurmc.org/docs/Configuration Can I make a feature request or report a bug? \ud83d\udd17 Of course you can! That's what makes Purpur better and better ^_^ If you need to report a bug, please let us know about it. Remember, we can't fix what we don't know is broke Bug Reports: https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur/issues/new If you have a feature request or suggestion, please keep in mind that we try to stay away from niche features that may only help 1 or 2 servers. Things like that are best suited to plugins or datapacks. If you are unsure, open a ticket anyways and we'll let you know \\o/ Feature Request: https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur/discussions/new Purpur has permissions? \ud83d\udd17 Yes. Purpur adds a few permissions for a few features and commands that it has added. Some permissions for specific features will not work unless you enable that feature in purpur.yml, too, so keep an eye out for those https://purpurmc.org/docs/Permissions What does <insert random config option> do? \ud83d\udd17 Stuff. No seriously, we get asked this quite a lot. We built this wiki to answer all these questions so we wouldn't have to repeat them daily. I promise, this wiki covers every single option in purpur.yml - you won't find any missing entries. (the only exception is when a new option gets added; it might take a day or two before the wiki updates) https://purpurmc.org/docs/Configuration Does Purpur have a Discord? \ud83d\udd17 Yes! It's where the Purpur community resides. Don't be afraid to poke your head in and take a peek! https://purpurmc.org/discord What does Purpur add/change from upstream? \ud83d\udd17 Quite a lot, actually. But none of it goes into effect unless you enable it in purpur.yml . We set everything we change to the default behaviors. If you don't edit anything in purpur.yml , running this JAR is no different than running Pufferfish. For the curious, you can view all the code changes on GitHub here: https://github.com/PurpurMC/Purpur/tree/master/patches Don't worry if you can't read code. Most people can't. We have this nice wiki that covers every single option in purpur.yml and all the new permission nodes added for some new features/commands. Does Purpur have feature X from Paper? \ud83d\udd17 Yes, that's how forks work. All features from upstream are inherited by design Vanilla -> CraftBukkit -> Spigot -> Paper -> Pufferfish -> Purpur We have it all ^_^ Do CraftBukkit/Spigot/Paper/Pufferfish plugins work on Purpur? \ud83d\udd17 Yes. The only time there's incompatibility is due to authors hard-coding support for CraftBukkit/Spigot, ignoring the existence of Paper and its forks. If you run into any bugs that you know are because of Purpur, create a ticket and/or join our Discord server so we can take a look. Is there a Purpur for MC insert random version here ? \ud83d\udd17 Maybe.

This vulnerability allows anybody to execute commands and run code on your server with minimal effort, and grab your backend server\u2019s public IP address. It exists for all vanilla Minecraft versions newer than 1.7.10, and affects every application that utilizes the library. Notably the vanilla client, all vanilla-based servers such as Paper and Purpur, Velocity, and Waterfall. If you run any other Java-based applications, such as Jenkins or UniFi, ensure they are up-to-date as well. Mojang has pushed a fix for all client versions 1.8 and newer. 1.7.10 and older are not vulnerable. Purpur has pushed a JAR containing a fix for 1.18.1, and published XML files for 1.18 and older. Plugins that shade or depend on older versions of the library will also require updates. Updating Purpur \ud83d\udd17 Due to the way our tooling works, we cannot push fixed JARs for versions older than the latest Minecraft release. Now is a good time to get off unsupported versions and onto the latest and greatest versions of the game. 1.18.1 and newer \ud83d\udd17 1.18.1 Builds #1464 and newer are patched. Download the latest builds here . 1.18 to 1.17 \ud83d\udd17 As stated above, Purpur does not provide a patched JAR. Instead, we provide an XML file that disables what causes the exploit. To install, download this XML file , place it in your server\u2019s root directory (where the JAR files are), and add -Dlog4j.configurationFile=purpur_log4j2_117.xml after java in your launch arguments. Warning This method has not been fully tested on 1.18.

Download this XML file to your server\u2019s root directory, and add -Dlog4j.configurationFile=purpur_log4j2_1141-1165.xml after java in your launch arguments. Beware of other plugins that claim to fix the exploit by redirecting the log to the system output stream, as Paper automatically redirects those calls back to Log4j. Filtering out the problematic string will not patch the exploit, as all filters can be bypassed in various ways. How it works \ud83d\udd17 To test if this exploit affects you, send ${jndi:ldap://127.0.0.1:1389/a} in your server\u2019s chat, and check your server\u2019s log. If the console shows any response, then your server is vulnerable. The flag, -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true , does not stop the exploit from functioning on versions older than 1.17. It only works on versions newer than 1.16.5, which already have better mitigations provided. A basic explanation of how the exploit works can be found here . Current knowledge indicates that all versions of Java can allow remote code execution, according to Paper\u2019s team 1 . For more information, read Mojang\u2019s blog post about the vulnerability .
